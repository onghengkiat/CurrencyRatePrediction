**Notes: The interactions with the application sometimes may not be responding due to the limited resources when using free-tier subscriptions on the Heroku platform which causes the Frontend and Backend servers to be deployed as different servers. This causes the possibility that the Backend server is booting when the HTTP requests are made by the Frontend server. Please try it again after about 20 seconds if any of the actions is not giving a valid response.**
